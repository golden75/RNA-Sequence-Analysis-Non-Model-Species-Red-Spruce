RNA Sequence Analysis for Non Model Species (Red Spruce)  

# RNA Sequcence Analysis of Non Model Species (Red Spruce)  

This repository is a usable, publicly available tutorial for analyzing differential expression data and creating topological gene networks. All steps have been provided for the UConn CBC Xanadu cluster here with appropriate headers for the Slurm scheduler that can be modified simply to run.  Commands should never be executed on the submit nodes of any HPC machine.  If working on the Xanadu cluster, you should use sbatch scriptname after modifying the script for each stage.  Basic editing of all scripts can be performed on the server with tools such as nano, vim, or emacs.  If you are new to Linux, please use [this](https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/unix-basics) handy guide for the operating system commands.  In this guide, you will be working with common bio Informatic file formats, such as [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format), [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format), [SAM/BAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)), and [GFF3/GTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_feature_format). You can learn even more about each file format [here](https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/resources-and-events/tutorials/file-formats-tutorial/). If you do not have a Xanadu account and are an affiliate of UConn/UCHC, please apply for one **[here](https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/contact-us/)**.

## 1. Introduction   

In this tutorial we will be analyzing RNA-Sequence data from pine needle samples of the red spruce. This data is not published and therefore can only be accessed through the Xanadu directory in "/UCHC/PublicShare/RNASeq_Workshop/RedSpruce/Reads/Illumina".  We will be using the red spruce as a "non-model" organism. You may be quite familiar with "model" organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Arabidopsis thaliana. What is it that makes an organism a "model"? A few things. But most critically, the ease with which the organisms may be grown in a controlled setting, how quick the organisms mature and may reproduce, the cost of growing and maintaining a population of an organism, and the ease with which the organism genomics may be manipulated manually. From this we see why the organisms listed prior are good models -- nemotodes, fruit flies, and weeds are small so do not take much space and may be grown in a laboratory, they reach maturity and reproduce at a very early age (in some instances at a week old!), are quite robust in needing few nutrients to survive, and lastly can be genetically modified quite easily (whether through artificial selection, transposable elements, or chemical mutagenesis). From all of this we can see why the [red spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picea_rubens) is not a great model!   

When an organism is called "model" there is an underlying assumption that very generous amounts of research have been performed on the species resulting in large pools of publicly available data. In biology and bioinformatics this means there are reference transcriptomes, structural annotations, known variant genotypes, and a wealth of other useful information in computational research. By contrast, when an organism is called "non-model" there is the underlying assumption that the information described prior will have to be generated by the research. This means that after extracting genetic data from a non-model organism, the researcher will then have to assemble the transcriptome, annotate the transcriptome, identify any pertinent genetic relationships, and so on. We can use this to develop a small map of our goals for analyzing our red spruce RNA samples. That is:

The data consists of 3 libraries under three different treatments:  
*  Ambient Carbondioxide condition  
*  Elevated Carbondioxide condition  
*  Cotreated for both condition  

In this workflow we have seperated each step into folders, where you can find the appropriate scripts in conjunction with each steps. When you clone the git repository, the below directory structure will be cloned into your working directory.

In this tutorial we will be using SLURM schedular to submit jobs to Xanadu cluster. In each script we will be using it will contain a header section which will allocate the resources for the SLURM schedular. The header section will contain:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=JOBNAME
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -c 1
#SBATCH --mem=1G
#SBATCH --partition=general
#SBATCH --qos=general
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=first.last@uconn.edu
#SBATCH -o %x_%j.out
#SBATCH -e %x_%j.err

```

Before beginning, we need to understand a few aspects of the Xanadu server. When first logging into Xanadu from your local terminal, you will be connected to the submit node. The submit node is the interface with which users on Xanadu may submit their processes to the desired compute nodes, which will run the process. Never, under any circumstance, run processes directly in the submit node. Your process will be killed and all of your work lost! This tutorial will not teach you shell script configuration to submit your tasks on Xanadu. Therefore, before moving on, read and master the topics covered in the [Xanadu tutorial](https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/resources-and-events/tutorials-2/xanadu/).  

Note:  
If you are woking in Xanadu cluster, the raw reads may not need to be copied into you directory. In the raw_data folder we have created a script called [initialize.sh](/raw_reads/initialize.sh) when executed will create sim-links to the actual read files. With this way we can avolid making unnessary copies of the read data.  
So once you ran the script the raw_reads folder will look like:  
```
raw_reads/
├── ambient.fastq 
├── cotreated.fastq 
├── elevated.fastq 
└── initialize.sh
```  

### Familiarizing yourself with the raw reads  

The reads with which we will be working have been sequenced using [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing.html). We assume that you are familiar with the sequencing technology. Let's have a look at the content of one of our reads, which are in the "fastq" format:  

```bash  
head -n 4 ambient.fastq
```  

which will show the first four lines in the fastq file:  

```
@HWI-ST318_0118:3:1:1185:2192#0/1
CCCTTCCTGAGATGTAAGTCCTGATCTTGANNNTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+HWI-ST318_0118:3:1:1185:2192#0/1
cbabc`cY``UVVZT^\\^^b\bbb`Z_BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
```

In here we see that first line corrosponds to the sample information followed by the length of the read, and in the second line corrosponds to the nucleotide reads, followed by the "+" sign where if repeats the information in the first line. Then the fourth line corrosponds to the quality score for each nucleotide in the first line.  


## 2. Quality Conrol   

### Quality control of Illumina reads using Sickle  
Step one is to perform quality control on the reads, and we will be using Sickle for the Illumina reads. To start with we have single-end reads.  


```
module load sickle/1.33
sickle se -f ../raw_reads/ambient.fastq -t illumina -o ambient.trimmed.fastq -q 30 -l 35
sickle se -f ../raw_reads/elevated.fastq -t illumina -o elevated.trimmed.fastq -q 30 -l 35
sickle se -f ../raw_reads/cotreated.fastq -t illumina -o cotreated.trimmed.fastq -q 30 -l 35
```  

The useage information on the sickle program:  
```bash
Usage: sickle se [options] -f <fastq sequence file> -t <quality type> -o <trimmed fastq file> 

Options:
-f, --fastq-file, Input fastq file (required)
-t, --qual-type, Type of quality values
		solexa (CASAVA < 1.3)
		illumina (CASAVA 1.3 to 1.7)
		sanger (which is CASAVA >= 1.8)
-o, --output-file, Output trimmed fastq file (required)
-q, --qual-threshold, trimming based on average quality in a window. Default 20.
-l, --length-threshold, Threshold to keep a read based on length after trimming. Default 20.
```  

The quality may be any score from 0 to 40. The default of 20 is much too low for a robust analysis. We want to select only reads with a quality of 30 or better. Additionally, the desired length of each read is 35bp. Again, we see that a default of 20 is much too low for analysis confidence. Lastly, we must know the scoring type. While the quality type is not listed on the SRA pages, most SRA reads use the "sanger" quality type. Unless explicitly stated, try running sickle using the sanger qualities. If an error is returned, try illumina. If another error is returned, lastly try solexa.  

The full slurm script which is called [sickle.sh](/quality_control/sickle.sh) is stored in the quality_control folder.
